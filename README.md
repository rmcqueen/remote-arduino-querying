### Known Gotchas
 - Web portal failing to connect? Make sure all relevant ports (:1883 and :8080) are all free and clean
 - Arduino failing to connect? Make sure your the hostname variable used is your ip4 address
 - The same Arduino sometime works and sometimes doesnt? Try changing your mac addres declared a little bit - the router may still think its in use from a previous run
