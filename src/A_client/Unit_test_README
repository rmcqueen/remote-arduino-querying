In Arduino unit test mode, the file B_Connect must have these parts commented out:
/*
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Ethernet.begin(mac);  
  connect();
  recordCount = 3;
  ptrRecordCount = &recordCount;
}

void loop() {
  if (!client.isConnected())
    connect();
  client.yield(100);
}
*/

Also, E_UnitTest's Complete code will be un-commented.
After development/modifications, to prevent excess CPU usage the opposite setup would be used for general usage.
